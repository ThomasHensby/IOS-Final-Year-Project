# IOS-Final-Year-Project

This is a application that was built as part of my final year dissertation project.  

Named: An application to choose and schedule the playing of 
games with friends.

The appliciation is a fully working IOS app written in SWIFT with a firebase NOSQL server attached.

Within this project I had to learn Swift, Using Apis, Firebase and testing. 

The whole project was created by me and a full dissertation created to explain the research, implementation, testing and evaluation.
